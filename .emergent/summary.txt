The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Baby Goats application to an advanced state, implementing core functionalities from MVP to robust features like Supabase integration for authentication, profiles, goals, and achievements, alongside significant performance, offline, and enterprise infrastructure enhancements. The final phase completed by the previous engineer was the Core Social Infrastructure.

Upon taking over, the current AI engineer's immediate task was to expand on these social features, as confirmed by the user. The engineer initiated the process by verifying the backend social infrastructure's functionality and performance. A significant challenge arose from conflicting file path information in the provided  and actual file system observations, leading to initial file not found errors for social screens. This was resolved by confirming the existence of these files in  and proceeding with their integration. The engineer then focused on enhancing the frontend by adding navigation for social features, creating a social notifications component, and integrating it into the main application. The final step of restarting the frontend encountered errors, indicating an unresolved environmental issue at the summary request time.

The Baby Goats project aims to be a mobile-first social platform for young athletes (8-16), fostering a champion mindset. Initially, an MVP was built with a public landing page, Supabase Email Magic Link authentication, a 3-step onboarding wizard, a dashboard, daily challenges, public profiles, and discovery features. Backend APIs for profiles, highlights, challenges, and stats, leveraging Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS policies and COPPA compliance, were critical. The application evolved to feature a sophisticated, aspirational UI/UX, including an Arena Glow welcome screen, full Elite Onboarding, real Supabase user authentication, Profile Photos/Avatars, Advanced Goal Tracking with analytics, and a gamified Achievement System. Subsequent development phases included full Supabase Storage integration for profile photos, comprehensive performance optimization (image optimization, lazy loading, caching), robust offline capabilities, and solid technical infrastructure (error monitoring, testing, security). The latest work completed focused on implementing core social features, including a friend system and activity feed.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the previous AI engineer completed the Core Social Infrastructure including the  library and initial social screens (, , ) located in . Backend validation confirmed their integration.

The current AI engineer's work began by continuing this social feature enhancement. After successfully restarting services and confirming backend social infrastructure functionality (72.7% success rate), the engineer focused on frontend integration. A brief confusion regarding the existence of social screen files was resolved, confirming their presence and existing comprehensive implementation. The engineer then proceeded to:
1.  **Integrate Social Navigation:** Modified  to include navigation links for the social profile, friends, and activity feed screens.
2.  **Add Social Section to Home:** Implemented a new section on the main home page with buttons for direct access to social features, along with necessary styling.
3.  **Implement Social Notifications:** Created a new component  to handle and display social notifications.
4.  **Integrate Notifications:** Incorporated the  component into , ensuring it utilizes the  for user-specific notifications.

The current state is that the core social features are now integrated into the frontend navigation and a social notification system has been added. The most recent action was an attempt to restart the frontend (expo) service, which reported errors and did not successfully start.
