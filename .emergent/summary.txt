The previous AI engineer effectively transformed the Baby Goats application. Initially, it resolved a critical architectural challenge by configuring the FastAPI backend as a proxy to correctly route frontend API calls to the Next.js API server. It also addressed Supabase RLS write restrictions for MVP purposes using an in-memory profile storage solution. Subsequently, the engineer fully integrated the Elite Onboarding flow for end-to-end data saving. A major effort was then made to establish real Supabase authentication, which involved setting up service role keys, updating various API routes, and adjusting frontend forms to match the existing database schema. Design consistency was a continuous focus. The application was further enhanced with Profile Photos/Avatars (utilizing a base64 fallback due to Supabase Storage complexities), a robust Advanced Goal Tracking system, and a comprehensive Achievement System with gamification elements. The trajectory concludes with the successful completion of the Achievement System, awaiting the user's next task.

The Baby Goats project is a mobile-first social platform targeting young athletes (8-16) to foster a champion mindset. Its initial MVP included a public landing page, Supabase Email Magic Link authentication, a 3-step onboarding wizard, a dashboard, daily challenges, public athlete profiles, and discovery features. Backend APIs for profiles, highlights, challenges, and stats were required, along with a Supabase PostgreSQL schema with RLS policies. COPPA compliance and a debug page were also specified.

The project evolved with a focus on a sophisticated, aspirational, built for champions UI/UX, moving from a kiddie aesthetic to an Arena Glow cinematic welcome screen, and a comprehensive landing page based on a detailed JSON specification, adhering to precise color and font requirements (Saira Extra Condensed, Inter). Subsequent major features included enabling full Elite Onboarding, implementing real user authentication with Supabase, adding Profile Photos/Avatars, developing Advanced Goal Tracking with analytics and visualization, and finally, a gamified Achievement System with badges and milestone recognition.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the previous AI engineer successfully completed the implementation of the **Achievement System**. This critical Tier 1 feature enhances user engagement through gamification. The work involved:

1.  **Achievement Infrastructure:** Establishing badge and milestone data models within .
2.  **Achievement Components:** Developing two new React Native components:  for visual representation of achievements, and  to provide celebratory animations when users earn new achievements.
3.  **Achievement Gallery Screen:** Creating a dedicated screen at  where users can view their collected achievements and progress.
4.  **Navigation Integration:** Seamlessly integrating the new  screen into the application's main navigation flow by updating , adding it as a navigable route and including a corresponding button on the home screen.

Backend testing confirmed the full functionality and integration of the Achievement System, reporting successful API interactions and data handling for achievement categories and points. The application now features a robust gamified system, ready to reward and motivate young athletes. The engineer is currently awaiting further instructions from the user on the next development step, having completed the last requested feature.
