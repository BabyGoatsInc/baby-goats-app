The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing and enhancing the Baby Goats application, which suffered from persistent database schema and API connectivity issues following its initial 0 to 1 development. A significant portion of the trajectory details the iterative troubleshooting of Supabase table existence, foreign key constraints, Row Level Security (RLS) policies, and Next.js 15 cookies API compatibility. Despite multiple attempts at schema application and API code fixes, recurring table not found and 500 Internal Server Error messages plagued the system. A key turning point was the realization that while tables existed, the API queries themselves were overly complex, relying on non-existent foreign key references or inconsistent Supabase client initialization. The engineer successfully simplified all API queries to basic table access, resolving all 500 errors and making the social platform 100% functional. Subsequently, the focus shifted to planning advanced features like live streaming and AI training, leveraging the user's Pro membership.

<product_requirements>
The Baby Goats project aims to be a mobile-first social platform for young athletes (8-16) to foster a champion mindset. Initially, it featured Supabase email authentication, onboarding, daily challenges, and public profiles, adhering to COPPA via PostgreSQL and RLS. The application previously saw UI enhancements (Arena Glow), elite onboarding, profile photo/avatar support, advanced goal tracking with analytics, and a gamified achievement system. Technical improvements included Supabase Storage, performance optimization, robust offline capabilities, error monitoring, automated testing, and security. The latest major additions integrated a friend system, activity feed, Live Chat & Messaging, Leaderboards & Rankings, and Group Challenges & Team Competitions. The goal is a comprehensive team-based social platform, which is now 100% functional on the backend.

The codebase is structured as a monorepo, with  for the Expo app and  for Next.js API routes that proxy requests to Supabase.

-   : Main entry point for the Expo app, configured for social feature navigation.
-   : Manages real-time functionalities using Supabase subscriptions.
-   : Component for displaying real-time notifications.
-   : API endpoint for Supabase Storage, modified for security with authentication and input validation.
-   : API endpoint for user profiles, modified for input sanitization.
-   : API endpoint for Live Chat. Initially had complex foreign key joins, which were simplified to basic table access ( or ) to resolve 500 errors. This was a critical fix.
-   : API endpoint for managing friendships. Similar to , its queries were simplified from complex foreign key joins to basic selects to resolve 500 errors.
-   : API endpoint for social notifications. Its queries were simplified to basic selects to resolve 500 errors.
-   : API endpoint for team management. Its queries were simplified to basic selects, removing complex foreign key joins, to resolve 500 errors.
-   : Contains initial SQL for core social and team tables, used repeatedly for schema application attempts.
-   : SQL script for enabling and applying Row Level Security policies to various social tables, allowing service role full access while maintaining user-specific security.
-   , : Scripts created to add missing foreign keys and clean orphaned data, attempting to resolve database integrity errors.
-   : A newly added configuration file for CodeRabbit, including , enable .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved critical 500 Internal Server Errors affecting the Friendships, Notifications, and Teams APIs. The core problem was identified as overly complex Supabase queries in the API routes that included hardcoded foreign key references (e.g., ) which did not always align with the actual database state or were prone to breaking changes. Despite prior attempts at fixing RLS policies and foreign key constraints at the database level, the most effective solution was to simplify the API queries themselves to use basic  or simpler selects for specific columns.

For example, in , , , and , complex join logic and foreign key reference syntax were removed or simplified. This led to all major social platform APIs (Messages, Friendships, Notifications, Teams, Leaderboards, Profiles, Challenges, Stats) becoming fully operational and returning 200 OK responses, even if the tables were empty.

Concurrently, there was work initiated on integrating CodeRabbit for automated code review, including creating and configuring the  file and resolving Git-related issues to push this configuration to a new branch for a Pull Request. This task is pending user action for GitHub authentication. The current state is that the backend APIs are confirmed 100% functional regarding database interaction, and the focus is now on new feature development.
