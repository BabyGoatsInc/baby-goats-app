The previous AI engineer established the Baby Goats application from MVP to include core features like Supabase authentication, profiles, goals, and achievements, alongside robust infrastructure enhancements. The current AI engineer then continued by integrating core social features (profiles, friends, feed) into the frontend navigation. A major challenge involved resolving complex Expo/Metro bundler version conflicts,  errors related to AsyncStorage/Supabase initialization, and deprecated styling warnings. The engineer systematically addressed these issues, temporarily using mock authentication to stabilize the frontend before successfully re-integrating real Supabase authentication. Finally, the engineer implemented foundational real-time social features, including a real-time infrastructure library, and components for live messaging and notifications, transforming the application into a live social experience.

The Baby Goats project is a mobile-first social platform for young athletes (8-16) fostering a champion mindset. It began with an MVP featuring a public landing page, Supabase email authentication, a 3-step onboarding wizard, dashboard, daily challenges, public profiles, and discovery, with backend APIs leveraging Supabase PostgreSQL and RLS for COPPA compliance. It evolved to a sophisticated UI/UX including Arena Glow, Elite Onboarding, real Supabase auth, profile photo/avatar support, advanced goal tracking with analytics, and a gamified achievement system. Further enhancements included full Supabase Storage for profile photos, comprehensive performance optimization (image optimization, lazy loading, caching), robust offline capabilities, and technical infrastructure (error monitoring, testing, security). The latest work implemented core social features like a friend system and activity feed, and now real-time social interactions.

<code_architecture>

-   : Main entry point. Modified to integrate social feature navigation links, a Connect With Champions section, and the  component. Subsequently updated to include the  component. Changes also involved temporarily commenting out and then re-enabling  usage.
-   : Library for managing friend systems, following, and social profile data. Part of the previous engineer's social infrastructure.
-   : Component for displaying social notifications. Created by the current engineer.
-   , , : Core social UI screens. Created by the previous engineer, integrated and refined by the current engineer.
-   : Centralized error tracking and reporting. Modified to handle  error by using conditional styling to avoid React Native specific styles during server-side rendering, and to explicitly import  and .
-   : Supabase client configuration. Modified to introduce a universal storage adapter to prevent  errors during server-side initialization, ensuring client-side only access to .
-   : React Context for authentication. Initially modified to provide a mock authentication for debugging frontend runtime issues, then fully restored with real Supabase authentication methods.
-   : Onboarding screen for sport selection. Modified to replace deprecated  style props with  for modern React Native styling.
-   : UI component for network status feedback. Modified to replace deprecated  style props.
-   : Elite onboarding screen. Modified to replace deprecated  style props.
-   : Expo's Metro bundler configuration. Modified to use a simplified configuration to resolve complex dependency conflicts and allow Expo to manage its own Metro versions.  was temporarily removed.
-   : New file created for foundational real-time infrastructure using Supabase Realtime.
-   : New file created for the live messaging UI component.
-   : New file created for the real-time notifications component.

<current_work>
The current AI engineer's work began by continuing the integration of Core Social Infrastructure components (, , , ) into the frontend. The engineer first integrated social navigation and a new social section on the main home page by modifying . A  component was created and integrated into the main application.

Significant effort was dedicated to troubleshooting persistent frontend service startup issues, specifically relating to Expo's Metro bundler, which involved  conflicts and  linked to  and Supabase initialization. The engineer used a  to diagnose these complex dependency conflicts. To bypass these, mock authentication was temporarily implemented in  and  was adjusted (including converting JSX to  and properly importing ).

After resolving these critical infrastructure and runtime errors, the real Supabase authentication was successfully re-integrated by modifying  and  to handle  compatibility robustly. Deprecated  style properties were then systematically updated to  across , , , and .

Most recently, the engineer initiated the development of real-time social features. This involved creating  for the core real-time infrastructure, and new UI components:  and . The  component has been integrated into , making the Baby Goats application a live social experience with foundational real-time capabilities. The last action successfully confirmed the integration of these real-time social features.
