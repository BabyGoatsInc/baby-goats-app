The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Baby Goats application from inception, focusing on core functionalities and a robust architecture. Initial work involved establishing FastAPI as a proxy for Next.js API calls and implementing an MVP profile storage solution. Key milestones included integrating the Elite Onboarding flow, transitioning to real Supabase authentication with RLS bypass via service role keys, and refining UI/UX. The application was enhanced with Profile Photo/Avatar functionality (initially base64 fallback), an Advanced Goal Tracking system, and a gamified Achievement System. The last completed feature was the Achievement System. The current task is to fully integrate Supabase Storage for profile photos, moving away from the base64 fallback. This involved updating frontend components and creating a new backend API for secure storage operations, addressing initial permission issues. The primary challenge currently faced is resolving Expo preview URL connectivity issues to enable frontend UI testing of the profile photo feature.

The Baby Goats project aims to be a mobile-first social platform for young athletes (8-16) to foster a champion mindset. The initial MVP included a public landing page, Supabase Email Magic Link authentication, a 3-step onboarding wizard, a dashboard, daily challenges, public athlete profiles, and discovery features. Backend APIs for profiles, highlights, challenges, and stats were required, along with a Supabase PostgreSQL schema with RLS policies, COPPA compliance, and a debug page.

The project evolved to emphasize a sophisticated, aspirational, built for champions UI/UX, featuring an Arena Glow welcome screen and a detailed landing page with specific color/font requirements (Saira Extra Condensed, Inter). Subsequent developments included enabling the full Elite Onboarding process, implementing real user authentication with Supabase, adding Profile Photos/Avatars, developing Advanced Goal Tracking with analytics and visualization, and creating a gamified Achievement System with badges and milestone recognition. The current phase is focused on moving towards full Supabase Storage integration for profile photos.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Full Supabase Storage Integration for Profile Photos:** The current implementation uses a base64/preset avatar fallback for the demo; full integration with Supabase Storage for persistent profile photos is still pending completion.
-   **Comprehensive Testing of All New Features:** While backend functionalities for Goals and Achievements are confirmed, a complete end-to-end testing suite for these features, including UI interactions, is still beneficial.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the previous AI engineer successfully completed the implementation of the **Achievement System**, which involved establishing data models, developing  and  components, creating the  screen, and integrating it into the main navigation flow. Backend testing confirmed its functionality.

The current work revolves around completing the **Full Supabase Storage Integration for Profile Photos**. This involves:
1.  **Installing **: (Chat Message 18) to handle file system operations in React Native.
2.  **Updating **: (Chat Messages 16, 20, 40) Initially, direct Supabase Storage calls were attempted. It was then modified to interact with a new backend API for storage operations, moving away from direct client-side Supabase Storage calls to leverage the service role key.
3.  **Creating **: (Chat Message 22) A script was created and run (Chat Message 25) to set up the Supabase storage bucket and policies programmatically.
4.  **Creating **: (Chat Message 39) A new Next.js API endpoint was created to handle Supabase Storage operations (like bucket creation and file management) securely using the , addressing previous permission issues encountered during direct client-side attempts.
5.  **Updating **: (Chat Messages 46, 48, 49, 50, 51) The component was modified to initialize the storage bucket when loading, use the new backend storage API, and include UI feedback for storage status.
6.  **Backend/Frontend URL Management**: The engineer faced issues with the Next.js server not running on the correct port and connection failures, leading to attempts to restart Next.js (Chat Messages 43, 57) and the FastAPI backend (Chat Messages 45, 59).  in  was also checked and confirmed (Chat Message 61).
7.  **Backend Testing**: After integrating the new storage API, backend tests were run (Chat Messages 35, 64), which confirmed that the storage integration is now working, including bucket management, file uploads, and profile avatar updates.
8.  **Frontend Troubleshooting**: The engineer then encountered critical infrastructure issues with the Expo preview URL (502 errors), preventing mobile UI testing. Multiple attempts were made to restart Expo (Chat Messages 67, 76, 86) and troubleshoot ngrok conflicts (Chat Message 83, 89), but the preview URL remains inaccessible. The current state is that the backend storage integration is confirmed, but frontend UI testing is blocked.

The engineer is currently stuck trying to resolve the Expo preview URL issue to proceed with frontend testing of the profile photo upload functionality.
