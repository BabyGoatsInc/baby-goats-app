<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully guided the Baby Goats application through several critical development phases. Starting from an MVP with FastAPI proxy and Next.js, the engineer focused on integrating Supabase for authentication, profiles, goals, and achievements. Key technical challenges included resolving Expo preview URL issues and ensuring robust Supabase Storage integration for profile photos. After stabilizing the core infrastructure, the focus shifted to performance optimization, introducing image optimization, lazy loading, and caching. Subsequently, comprehensive offline capabilities were added, followed by the implementation of enterprise-level error monitoring, testing, and security enhancements. Most recently, the engineer completed the Core Social Infrastructure, laying the foundation for social features like friend systems and activity feeds. The trajectory showcases a systematic, problem-solving approach, addressing infrastructure nuances while consistently adding significant features.

The Baby Goats project is a mobile-first social platform for young athletes (8-16) to cultivate a champion mindset. The initial MVP included a public landing page, Supabase Email Magic Link auth, a 3-step onboarding wizard, dashboard, daily challenges, public profiles, and discovery features. Backend APIs for profiles, highlights, challenges, and stats were essential, along with a Supabase PostgreSQL schema with RLS policies and COPPA compliance. The project evolved to feature a sophisticated, aspirational UI/UX, including an Arena Glow welcome screen. Subsequent enhancements included full Elite Onboarding, real Supabase user authentication, Profile Photos/Avatars, Advanced Goal Tracking with analytics, and a gamified Achievement System. The work progressed to full Supabase Storage integration for profile photos, comprehensive performance optimization, robust offline capabilities, and solid technical infrastructure (error monitoring, testing, security). The latest completed phase introduces core social features like a friend system and activity feed.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture consisting of an Expo/React Native frontend, a FastAPI proxy backend, and a Next.js API server interacting with Supabase PostgreSQL and Storage.



-   : FastAPI backend, acts as a proxy for Next.js API calls. It was modified to correct the proxy target from  to  to match the Next.js server.
-   : New Next.js API endpoint to securely handle Supabase Storage operations using the service role key, bypassing client-side RLS limitations.
-   : Script to programmatically set up Supabase storage buckets and policies.
-   : Modified to ensure  is correct and to remove hardcoded  to facilitate fresh tunnel creation.
-   : The main entry point. It has been significantly modified over time to integrate various new features: , , and new navigation links for , , and  features. It now also initializes core technical infrastructure.
-   : Utility for image storage. Modified to interact with the new backend storage API, moving away from base64 and direct client-side Supabase Storage calls.
-   : UI component for profile photo selection. Modified to integrate with Supabase Storage via the new backend API, incorporating image optimization and UI feedback.

-   : **(New File)** Component for lazy loading screens, enabling performance-optimized loading.
-   : **(New File)** Utility for memory management and performance monitoring, tracking memory usage and API response times.
-   : **(New File)** Intelligent API caching system with TTL, persistent storage, and LRU eviction, used with a  hook.
-   : **(New File)** Manages network state, using  for real-time connectivity monitoring and background sync triggers.
-   : **(New File)** Provides an offline-first data layer with local storage, optimistic updates, and conflict resolution.
-   : **(New File)** UI component to provide visual feedback on network status and sync operations.
-   : **(New File)** Implements comprehensive error tracking, performance monitoring, and crash reporting.
-   : **(New File)** Sets up automated testing infrastructure including unit, integration, performance, and security test suites.
-   : **(New File)** Provides security enhancements like input validation, authentication security, and data encryption.
-   : **(New File)** Acts as an integrated manager for initializing and coordinating all new technical systems (error, testing, security).
-   , , : **(New Files)** Core social UI screens for enhanced profiles, friend management, and activity feed.
-   : **(New File)** Library for managing friend systems, following, and social profile data.

<pending_tasks>
-   Frontend UI testing for the Profile Photo Integration (blocked by Expo preview URL issues previously, now resolved).
-   Comprehensive end-to-end testing suite for Goals and Achievements, including UI interactions.
-   Further enhancements to security input sanitization (noted as an area for improvement).
-   Refinement of cross-system error handling coordination (minor integration improvements needed).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the previous AI engineer successfully completed the implementation of the **Core Social Infrastructure** for the Baby Goats application. This involved:

1.  **Setting up Social System Libraries**: Creating  to manage friend relationships, following, and social profile data.
2.  **Developing Core Social Screens**:
    *   : For enhanced social profiles.
    *   : For friend management.
    *   : For the activity feed.
3.  **Integrating Social Features into the Main App**: Modifying  to add navigation links and integrate the new social components into the main application flow.
4.  **Backend Validation**: Running comprehensive backend tests to confirm that the new social system components integrate seamlessly with existing APIs and data layers, confirming data structures and performance ( and ).

This work establishes the fundamental social features for the application, enabling functionalities like friend requests, follower systems, enhanced athlete profiles, and real-time activity feeds, all while maintaining the previously achieved performance, security, and offline capabilities. The current state is that the core social infrastructure is technically complete and validated on the backend.
