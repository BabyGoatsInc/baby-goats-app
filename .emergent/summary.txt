The AI engineer successfully transitioned the project from an initial Expo setup to a Next.js 15 application using Supabase for the backend, as per the user's updated requirements. The trajectory shows a highly iterative process, particularly with database schema management. The AI meticulously built out all core MVP features including authentication, onboarding, dashboard, challenges, and public profiles. Significant effort was spent debugging and refining the Supabase SQL schema, addressing syntax errors, missing columns, and ensuring safe migrations with existing data. The AI demonstrated strong problem-solving in adapting to the user's specific database state and fixing SQL errors multiple times. The MVP is now functionally complete, and the focus has shifted to design enhancements based on provided mockups.

The Baby Goats project aims to build a mobile-first social platform for young athletes (8-16) focused on developing a champion mindset (Resilient, Relentless, Fearless). It is envisioned as TikTok meets sports recruiting. The application needs to be built with Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript), TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, and Supabase (Auth, Postgres, RLS). It must extend an existing GitHub repository (), committing all work to a  branch.

Core user flows include:
- **Landing Page ():** Public hero section, CTA to sign-in.
- **Authentication:** Supabase Email Magic Link, redirecting to  if profile incomplete, else .
- **Onboarding ():** A 3-step wizard (Choose Sport, Who's Your GOAT, Add First Highlight).
- **Dashboard ():** Profile summary, quick actions (add highlight, update stats, complete challenge), recent activity feed.
- **Challenges ():** Daily challenges across 'Resilient', 'Relentless', 'Fearless' categories with streak tracking.
- **Public Profile ():** Showcase stats, video highlights, character badges.
- **Discover ():** Search and filter athletes.
- **API Routes:** For profiles, highlights, challenges, stats.
- **Database Schema:** , , , , , ,  tables with RLS policies, various constraints, and performance indexes.
- **Seed Data:** Inclusion of 30+ challenges and 3 sample athletes (Josh Bradley, Ryan Thompson, Maya Rodriguez) with associated highlights and stats.
- **Safety & Compliance:** Parent permission system for COPPA compliance.
- **Debug Page ():** Existing functionality preserved and enhanced with Supabase connection status, environment variables, table row counts, and sample data insertion buttons.

The MVP functionality is complete and verified, including the database schema with data validation, RLS, and seed data.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend/Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Row Level Security - RLS)
- **Database Operations:** SQL migrations with , , , ,  for auto-updates.
- **Authentication:** Supabase Email Magic Link

-   : Configures Next.js dependencies and scripts. Initial Expo setup was replaced.
-   : Stores  and . Updated with user-provided Supabase credentials.
-   , , : Core configuration files for Next.js, PostCSS, and TailwindCSS respectively.
-   : TypeScript configuration, updated to include path aliases (e.g., ) for easier imports.
-   : Global CSS for TailwindCSS.
-   : Root layout for the Next.js application.
-   : The primary landing page.
-   : Existing debug page maintained and enhanced to show Supabase connection status and table row counts.
-   : Supabase client initialization, using environment variables. This file was retained as per requirements.
-   : Contains  components (Button, Input, Label, DropdownMenu, Form) which serve as the UI foundation.
-    & : Implements the 3-step user onboarding flow.
-   , , , : Core application pages, created to fulfill the routing requirements.
-   , , , , , : Various iterations of SQL scripts to create/migrate the Supabase database schema, incorporating RLS, constraints, indexes, triggers, and sample data. These files were created to guide the user in setting up their Supabase database correctly.
-   : A markdown file providing instructions on how to run the SQL schema in Supabase.

<current_work>
The Baby Goats MVP is functionally complete and stable. The application is a Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript) project, utilizing TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui for the frontend, and Supabase for authentication and database management. All core pages and user flows (Landing, Authentication, Onboarding, Dashboard, Challenges, Public Profile, Discover) are in place. The Supabase database schema has been meticulously developed and refined through multiple iterations, incorporating 7 tables (, , , , , , ), comprehensive RLS policies, data validation constraints (e.g., email format, grad year, non-empty fields), and performance indexes. Triggers for  timestamps and automatic likes count updates have also been implemented. Sample data (32 challenges, 3 athletes, highlights, and stats) has been successfully inserted into the database. The debug page is fully functional and provides insight into the Supabase connection and table states. The immediate prior work involved resolving persistent database migration errors, which were finally fixed with a step-by-step SQL script, ensuring all columns and constraints are correctly applied and sample data is inserted. The last user interaction was providing design mockups, indicating a shift from functional completion to aesthetic enhancement. The AI engineer's last action was acknowledging the stunning design and outlining a plan to update the UI to match the premium vision.
