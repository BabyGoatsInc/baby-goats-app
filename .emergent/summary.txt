The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Baby Goats application development, transitioning from an initial Expo setup to a Next.js 15 application with Supabase. The work trajectory demonstrates an iterative and robust development process, particularly in managing the database schema and API integration. The AI meticulously built the core MVP features, including authentication, onboarding, dashboard, challenges, and public profiles. Key challenges included debugging Supabase SQL schema issues, clarifying the application's Next.js/Expo hybrid nature (Next.js for frontend and APIs, Expo for mobile-specific rendering), and resolving dependency conflicts. The MVP's functional completion led to a shift towards aesthetic enhancements, culminating in the ambitious Elite Onboarding Experience. The AI consistently adapted to user feedback, fixed identified issues, and maintained a clear communication log, ensuring foundational stability and continuous feature development.

The Baby Goats project aims to be a mobile-first social platform for young athletes (8-16), fostering a champion mindset (Resilient, Relentless, Fearless). The app is built with Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript), TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, and Supabase (Auth, Postgres, RLS). It extends an existing GitHub repository () on a  branch. Core user flows include a public landing page, Supabase Email Magic Link authentication (redirecting to onboarding or dashboard), a 3-step onboarding wizard, a dashboard with profile summaries and activity feed, daily challenges, public athlete profiles, and athlete discovery. The application requires API routes for profiles, highlights, challenges, and stats. The Supabase database schema must include , , , , , ,  tables with RLS, constraints, indexes, and triggers. Seed data for challenges and sample athletes is required. COPPA compliance via a parent permission system is critical. A debug page to monitor Supabase status and data counts is also necessary. The MVP functionality, including the database schema, RLS, and seed data, is now complete and verified.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend/Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Row Level Security - RLS)
- **State Management:** Zustand (recently added)
- **Animation:** ,  (for web-based animations)
- **API Integration:** Custom  utilities for client-side fetches.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application features a full-stack architecture with a Next.js 15 frontend and API layer, an Expo-based React Native mobile frontend, and a FastAPI backend with a Supabase PostgreSQL database. The core development is centered within the  directory.



-   : Stores Supabase credentials.
-   : New Next.js App Router API endpoints for profiles, highlights, challenges, stats, and likes. These provide a unified interface for frontend data interaction.
-   : New Next.js middleware for handling Supabase authentication sessions and redirects.
-   : A custom utility file centralizing API calls to the Next.js API routes, improving maintainability and error handling.
-   : New modular Supabase client setup for both client-side () and server-side () operations, and middleware specific utilities ().
-   : New components for authentication ( for context,  for login/signup).
-   , , : New pages and API route for the complete Supabase authentication flow.
-   : The landing page, updated to integrate with the new authentication flow.
-   , , : Core application pages, significantly updated to fetch data via the newly implemented  endpoints using the  utilities.
-   : A new component to handle liking highlights, integrated into the dashboard.
-   : A Zustand store for managing the state of the new, multi-step elite onboarding experience.
-   : The first user-facing component for the elite onboarding, implementing the Hero Impact screen with animations.
-   : A new entry point specifically for the advanced Elite Onboarding Experience, separate from the original simplified onboarding.
-   SQL files (, etc.): Various iterations of SQL scripts to set up and migrate the Supabase database schema, including RLS policies, constraints, indexes, and triggers, essential for the application's data integrity and security.

The Next.js application runs on port 3002 (frontend and API routes), while an Expo development server (for React Native mobile preview) runs on port 3000. A FastAPI backend is also running on port 8001, primarily for  routes that are redirected by Kubernetes ingress rules.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement the remaining phases of the Elite Onboarding Experience as per the detailed user-provided plan.
- Implement the comprehensive UI enhancement based on the user's design research and mockups, following the questionnaire.
- Configure Supabase RLS policies to enable write operations for all users, aligning with the planned user authentication.

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on developing the Baby Goats App Onboarding Experience, an ambitious multi-phase system combining sports psychology with advanced UX design. The AI engineer is currently implementing the **Elite Onboarding Initiative**, specifically starting Phase 2: Experience Level Assessment and Goal-Setting Workshop.

So far, the technical foundation for this elite onboarding has been laid:
- The necessary animation libraries (, ) were installed, resolving initial dependency conflicts related to the Next.js environment.
- Zustand, a state management library, was integrated, and a dedicated store () was created to manage the complex, multi-step onboarding flow.
- The Welcome Screen Sequence (Hero Impact screen) has been developed as . This component is designed to be the first visual experience for new users, incorporating animated silhouettes and a pulsating Begin Your Journey CTA.
- A new dedicated entry point for this advanced onboarding, , has been created. This page will host the integrated elite onboarding components.
- Initial testing with screenshots confirmed that the new  route correctly redirects unauthenticated users to the login page, validating the integrated authentication system.

The current work is transitioning from setting up the foundational infrastructure for the Elite Onboarding to building its specific user-facing components, with Experience Level Assessment being the next component to be developed.
