The AI engineer's work involved enhancing the Baby Goats application with social and real-time features. Initially, the focus was on core social elements and resolving runtime issues. After successfully developing Live Chat, Leaderboards, and Group Challenges, the engineer shifted focus to testing and bug fixes, specifically Profile Photo Integration and critical security vulnerabilities. A major ongoing challenge is the manual Supabase database schema application, which has repeatedly failed due to user copy-paste errors and quote encoding issues. The engineer has systematically isolated the problem, creating progressively simpler SQL files for the user to execute, demonstrating persistence in troubleshooting a difficult external interaction.

<product_requirements>
The Baby Goats project is a mobile-first social platform for young athletes (8-16), fostering a champion mindset. It began with core features like Supabase email authentication, onboarding, daily challenges, and public profiles, adhering to COPPA compliance via PostgreSQL and RLS. The application evolved through several phases: Arena Glow UI enhancements, elite onboarding, profile photo/avatar support, advanced goal tracking with analytics, and a gamified achievement system. Technical infrastructure improvements included Supabase Storage, performance optimization (image, lazy loading, caching), robust offline capabilities, error monitoring, automated testing, and security. The latest major additions integrated a friend system and activity feed, and crucially, Live Chat & Messaging, Leaderboards & Rankings, and Group Challenges & Team Competitions, aiming to create a comprehensive team-based social platform.

<current_work>
The immediate focus shifted from implementing new social features to ensuring the existing codebase's stability and security, and crucially, resolving the blocking issue of database schema deployment. Previously, the AI engineer completed the code for Live Chat & Messaging, Leaderboards & Rankings, and Group Challenges & Team Competitions, including frontend UI and backend API routes. However, the critical database schemas for these features (, ) were not applied to Supabase, leading to Could not find table API errors.

The AI engineer successfully tested and confirmed the functionality of the Profile Photo Integration (68.8% backend, successful frontend). Following this, a significant effort was made to address security vulnerabilities, particularly improving input sanitization. The  and  files were extensively modified to include JWT validation and robust input validation/sanitization, which passed re-testing.

The current, most pressing work revolves around assisting the user in manually applying the database schema to Supabase. This has become a complex debugging task due to repeated copy-paste errors by the user, leading to SQL syntax errors (, , ). The AI engineer has generated multiple refined SQL files (, , , , , ) in an attempt to provide a version that can be executed successfully, with  being the latest, a highly simplified version to isolate the copy-paste/encoding issue. The core problem is that the social tables are still not created in Supabase.
