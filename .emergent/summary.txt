The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the Baby Goats application from an MVP into a sophisticated, mobile-first platform. The initial focus was on core features and a UI/UX redesign towards an elite athlete aesthetic. This trajectory saw the completion of the Elite Onboarding Experience including new assessment and goal-setting screens. A significant architectural challenge emerged where frontend API calls targeted a basic FastAPI backend, while the actual application logic resided in a separate Next.js API. This was ingeniously resolved by implementing a FastAPI proxy, forwarding requests to the Next.js API. Finally, the critical RLS policy issue, blocking write operations, was addressed with an MVP in-memory profile storage solution, ensuring the Elite Onboarding flow could save user data end-to-end, albeit in a temporary, non-persistent manner.

The Baby Goats project aims to be a mobile-first social platform for young athletes (8-16) to cultivate a champion mindset. The initial MVP included a public landing page, Supabase Email Magic Link authentication, a 3-step onboarding wizard, a dashboard, daily challenges, public athlete profiles, and discovery features. Backend APIs for , , , and  were required, along with a Supabase PostgreSQL schema encompassing RLS policies, constraints, indexes, triggers, and seed data. COPPA compliance via parent permission and a debug page were also specified. The project subsequently focused on a sophisticated Elite Onboarding Experience and a Daily Challenges system, with a mobile-first approach inspired by Emergent app aesthetics. Latest directives involved a comprehensive UI/UX redesign, moving from a kiddie appearance to a sophisticated, aspirational, built for champions look across Home, Auth, Profile, and Challenges (Training Protocols) screens. User explicitly requested a minimalist home screen, then an Arena Glow cinematic welcome screen, and finally a comprehensive landing page based on a detailed JSON specification, including precise color (only JOIN THE LEGACY in red) and font (Saira Extra Condensed, Inter) requirements.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend Frameworks:** Expo/React Native for mobile.
-   **Backend/Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, RLS - though bypassed for MVP writes), FastAPI for proxying, In-memory storage for MVP profiles.
-   **Routing:**  for file-based routing.
-   **State Management:** Zustand (for Elite Onboarding state).
-   **Styling:** React Native , .
-   **Animations:** .
-   **Fonts:** , , .
-   **HTTP Client:**  (for FastAPI proxy).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a dual-backend architecture with a Next.js server handling Supabase interactions and a FastAPI server acting as a proxy. The mobile frontend is an Expo/React Native application.



-   : Main entry point and Home Screen for the Expo mobile app.
    -   **Importance:** Dictates initial user experience; central navigation.
    -   **Changes:** Already refined for Arena Glow and comprehensive JSON landing page (color/font updates). No new functional changes in this trajectory's active work beyond existing design.
-   : Manages the multi-step Elite Onboarding experience.
    -   **Importance:** Central to the Elite Onboarding Experience flow.
    -   **Changes:** Updated to integrate newly created  and  screens, adding state variables, handler functions, and screen rendering logic. Also updated the completion screen to call the new  endpoint for saving data.
-   : **(New File)** Implements the Experience Level Assessment screen for Elite Onboarding.
    -   **Importance:** A core step in the multi-phase Elite Onboarding flow.
-   : **(New File)** Implements the Goal-Setting Workshop screen for Elite Onboarding.
    -   **Importance:** Another core step in the multi-phase Elite Onboarding flow.
-   : The FastAPI backend application.
    -   **Importance:** Serves as the primary  endpoint for the frontend.
    -   **Changes:** Transformed into an API proxy. It now intercepts requests to  (and implicitly ) and forwards them to the Next.js API server (http://localhost:3001), handling request/response translation.  was added as a dependency for this functionality.
-   : **(New File)** A Next.js API route created for debugging and checking Supabase RLS policies.
    -   **Importance:** Used to programmatically verify RLS status, confirming write blocks. It was part of an attempt to manage RLS directly.
-   : **(New File)** A Next.js API route that implements in-memory (MVP) storage for user profiles.
    -   **Importance:** Provides a temporary solution for write operations (POST/PUT) for the Elite Onboarding flow, bypassing Supabase RLS limitations for MVP demonstration. GET requests combine existing Supabase data with this in-memory data.
-   : Python dependency file for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance:** Lists all necessary Python packages.
    -   **Changes:**  was added to support HTTP client functionality required for the FastAPI proxy.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Permanent Supabase RLS Configuration:** While an MVP in-memory solution exists, configuring Supabase RLS policies to allow write operations directly to the database for authenticated users is still a pending task for a production-ready system.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed Phase 3 of the project, focusing on enabling full functionality for the Elite Onboarding experience for MVP demonstration. This involved a multi-faceted approach to address the Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies blocking write operations and the architectural challenge of routing API calls.

The core of the work revolved around:
1.  **Elite Onboarding Completion:** The previously designed Experience Level Assessment () and Goal-Setting Workshop () screens, created in Phase 1, were fully integrated into the Elite Onboarding flow managed by . This file now handles the complete user journey, collecting data across these screens.
2.  **FastAPI Proxy Implementation:** A critical architectural fix was implemented. The  FastAPI backend was transformed into a proxy. It now intercepts all  requests from the Expo frontend and intelligently forwards them to the actual Next.js API routes (e.g., , , etc.) running on . This solved the issue where frontend API calls were incorrectly targeting a basic FastAPI server instead of the Supabase-backed Next.js APIs. The  library was installed and used in  to enable this proxy functionality.
3.  **MVP Profile Management:** To overcome the Supabase RLS policy limitations for write operations (e.g., saving a new user profile after onboarding) without direct admin access, a temporary MVP solution was implemented. A new Next.js API route, , was created. This route now handles POST/PUT requests for profiles by storing them in a simple in-memory data structure (bypassing the database). GET requests to the profiles API are designed to return a combined view of existing Supabase data and these new in-memory MVP profiles.
4.  **Integration of Onboarding with MVP API:** The  file was updated to specifically call this new  endpoint upon completion of the Elite Onboarding, ensuring that the collected user data (even if temporarily) is saved, demonstrating a fully functional flow from frontend to backend within the MVP scope.

The last action was restarting the Expo frontend service (, ) after confirming that all backend components (FastAPI proxy, Next.js MVP API) were successfully working and communicating, allowing the Elite Onboarding flow to save user profiles end-to-end for demonstration purposes.

<optional_next_step>
Given that the MVP functionality is declared COMPLETE, the next step is to await user instructions for further enhancements or transitioning from MVP mode to full production with persistent Supabase writes.
